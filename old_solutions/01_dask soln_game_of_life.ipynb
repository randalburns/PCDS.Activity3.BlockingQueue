    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to learn to program dask arrays with partitioned overlap for lock-step time-series simulation with geometric decomposition. This is a common paradigm for programming in the sciences.\n",
    "* dask arrays -- grid is partitioned into chunks\n",
    "* overlap -- chunks share boundary or ghost cells\n",
    "* lock-step time-series simulation -- every cell updates at every point in time. Same computation model as finite-difference simulation or direct numerical simulation.\n",
    "* geometric decomposition -- parallel programming lingo for breaking stuff into chunks, i.e. decompose the data which defines parallel tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore these issues in a simulation of cellular automata. Cellular automata are of wide interest. Wolfram puts forth that simple automata exhibit the complexity that underlies natural phenomena. This is tenet of the field of digital physics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata).\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it simple, we will focus on Conwayâ€™s game of life. One of the earliest and best studied 2-d cellular automata.\n",

    "The following resources may be helpful in understanding the game of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "* http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/mcell/whatis_life.html gives a simple and intuitive description of the rules of Life and how to evaluate them on a grid. \n",
    "* http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ provides another description of the game of life. The applet there includes many common life patterns that you may use to evaluate your code. We will use the glider pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo without dask\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows the \"small exploder\" pattern run on a NumPy array. The function that evaluates the rules is designed so that it will work in a dask distributed implementation with one cell of overlap or one ghost cell.  More on this later.  For now, this function computes the rules for all internal cells."
